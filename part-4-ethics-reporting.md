# Part 4: Ethics & Reporting

### 4.1 Ensure Ethical Conduct

Behind every data point is a person. Ethical conduct is non-negotiable.

* **Ethical Approval**: Get approval from a Research Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board (IRB) before you start.
* **Informed Consent**: Participants must be fully informed about the study and voluntarily agree to participate, knowing they can withdraw at any time.
* **Confidentiality**: Protect participants' data and ensure anonymity in all reports.

### 4.2 Interpret and Discuss Your Results

A number is just a number until you explain what it means. For content guide in the research proposal [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14_7a6IB8dNycSwBHNhEyKrJ4i46flsq2/view?usp=share_link).

* **Interpretation of Results**: Translate statistical findings back into meaningful health context. For example, a statistically significant association (P < 0.05) between low education and poor knowledge suggests that health intervention should target this group with simpler, more accessible materials.
* **Precision**: How precise is your estimate? Look at the 95% confidence intervals.
  * Example: "The prevalence was 23.5% (95% CI: 20.1%â€“26.9%), suggesting that nearly 1 in 4 students may need support".
* **Context**: Compare your findings to other studies and discuss the real-world implications for healthcare or policy.
* **Limitations**: Be honest about your study's weaknesses. For instance, if you used convenience sampling, acknowledge that your results may not be generalizable. Limitations are not excuses for wrong methods, not confessions of slackness nor explanation of constrained resources that are required for the study. Limitations are imperfections of valid and rigorous study designs for the research question and study objectives, and feasibly planned for the actual conducts, which must be categorically correct but inadequate as required at higher levels.
* **Conclusion and Recommendations**: Begin your conclusion by synthesizing your findings to provide direct and clear answers to your initial research questions or objectives. Building on this, answer the crucial "so what?" question by emphasizing the broader implications and significance of your work, clearly stating its contribution to the field. Make sure the conclusions take into account the study's limitations. If possible, provide actionable recommendations based on the findings, proposing specific, impactful directions for future inquiry.
* **Reporting**: Follow standard reporting guidelines, such as STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology), to ensure your research is transparent, comprehensive, and reproducible (www.strobe-statement.org).

### 4.3 Practical Planning

A good plan includes a budget, a timeline (a Gantt chart is useful), and documented support from your team and institution. By following these structured steps, you can transform your initial curiosity into a solid, ethical, and impactful research study. Congratulations on taking this important step!
