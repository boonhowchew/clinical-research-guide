# Part 1: Finding Your Idea

The first, and often most challenging, step is identifying a research topic. This involves spotting gaps in current knowledge and shaping a broad idea into a focused, feasible research question. For a further elaboration [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fxx5Lif0qDs4GTF5mYaHloyDzVj3Kupb/view?usp=share_link).

## 1.1 Identify a Research Gap

A research gap is an area that lacks sufficient exploration, has unresolved issues, or shows contradictory findings in existing literature. Identifying a gap ensures your work contributes something new and valuable.

Types of Research Gaps to Look For:

* **Knowledge Gaps**: Topics that are new or understudied, such as the mental health impact of emerging social media platforms. This might be gotten from comprehensive systematic review.
* **Conceptual Gaps**: Theories or ideas that are inconsistently defined or understood, like the complex relationship between economic inequality and health outcomes.
* **Methodological Gaps**: Areas where existing research methods are insufficient to study a problem accurately, or the issues have not been investigated from different or rigorous manners.
* **Data Gaps**: A lack of reliable, complete, or long-term data needed to draw firm conclusions, such as in regional climate science on certain health conditions.
* **Practical Gaps**: A disconnect between theoretical knowledge and its real-world application, like testing effective teaching strategies in actual classrooms.

Techniques for Finding Gaps:

* **Comprehensive Literature Review**: Read current research papers, systematic reviews, and clinical guidelines to find unanswered questions or outdated findings. See further below.
* **Examine Study Limitations**: The "limitations" section of published articles often points directly to areas needing further research.
* **Observe Clinical Practice**: Notice patterns in patient presentation, treatment responses, or healthcare access that don't align with existing literature.
* **Engage in Discussions**: Talk with peers, mentors, and experts at conferences or journal clubs to brainstorm and validate potential research ideas.

## 1.2 Literature Reviews in Clinical Research

A literature review is the methodical process of mastering the evidence, but it's important to know that it is a dynamic and iterative cycle in the early effort, and after the review completion especially in fast evolving fields. It is not a straight path as some might have thought. For example, a preliminary search for evidence might lead you to refine your initial question, just as synthesizing your findings can reveal unexpected gaps that require you to search again.

A literature review is a critical and sophisticated task. Many people think it's just a long summary of everything they've read. The key shift in thinking is from **summarizing** to **synthesizing and creating an argument**. Think of it like a physician's consultation for a patient. You don't just list the patient's individual test results (a summary). You interpret them, connect them to the patient's history, identify what's missing, and present a coherent clinical opinion and a plan (a synthesis and argument). A literature review does the same for a research topic.

This table dispels common misconceptions.

| A Literature Review **IS**...                                                                                                                | A Literature Review **IS NOT**...                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **An argument that synthesizes findings into a coherent whole.** It connects different studies to tell a larger story about what is known. | ❌ **A list of summaries** of one paper after another (an annotated bibliography).                                                                 |
| ✅ **A critical evaluation** of the quality, relevance, contribution, and limitations of the existing work.                                   | ❌ **A simple collection of facts,** quotes, or findings without understanding the study's PECOTS or relate to them in your interpretation.        |
| ✅ **A foundation that justifies the need for your new research.** It demonstrates that a specific gap exists that your study will address.   | ❌ **An opinion piece or a general essay** about a topic. Your argument must be grounded in the evidence you present.                              |
| ✅ **A structured and focused narrative** that is organised by common themes, ideas, or theories.                                             | ❌ **A chronological or haphazard list** of everything ever published on a topic. It requires selective and purposeful organization.               |
| ✅ **A demonstration of your command of the topic,** showing that you understand the key concepts, landmark studies, and current debates.     | ❌ **Just about what others have said.** Your authorial voice is essential for weaving the different sources together into a compelling narrative. |
| ✅ **A map of the current state of knowledge,** which is dynamic and will evolve as new research (including your own) is published.           | ❌ **The final, definitive word** on a subject. It is a snapshot in time.                                                                          |

This dynamic cycle involves several core activities:

* Step 1: Starting with a Clinical Observation and Formulating a Focused Question
* Step 2: Developing and Executing a Search Strategy
* Step 3: Screening and Selecting Studies Systematically
* Step 4: Critically Appraising the Evidence
* Step 5: Extracting and Synthesizing the Findings
* Step 6: Identifying Gaps and Clinical Relevance
* Step 7: Constructing Your Argument and Positioning Your Research

The detailed guide [HERE](resources/literature-review.md) will further elaborate on each of the seven steps, helping you navigate the cycles of the literature review with confidence.

The term "**literature review**" itself represents a spectrum of methodologies. When used generally, it often refers to a **Narrative Review**, which tells the story of the existing research to build an argument for a new study. As your research questions become more focused and the need for rigor increases, other methodologies come into play. A **Systematic Review**, for instance, uses a strict protocol to answer a specific question like "_Is Drug A better than Drug B?_", while a **Scoping Review** maps the extent of research in a broad field to see what is known and where the major gaps lie. See the table below on the defining features of these three common types of review.

| Feature                  | _Traditional_ Literature Review                                               | Scoping Review (In-between)                                                                                                       | Systematic Review                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Goal**         | To provide context, critique literature, and identify gaps for a new study.   | To map the extent, range, and nature of research activity; to identify key concepts and gaps in a broad topic area.               | To answer a specific, focused research question by identifying, appraising, and synthesizing all relevant evidence.                    |
| **Research Question**    | Often broad and may evolve during the process.                                | Broader than a systematic review; focused on mapping concepts. Often uses a framework like PCC (Population, Concept, Context).    | Narrow and precisely defined before the review, often using a framework like PICO or PECOTS.                                           |
| **Search Strategy**      | Aims to be comprehensive but is often not fully documented or reproducible.   | Systematic and explicit. The search must be documented, comprehensive, and reproducible, similar to a systematic review.          | Systematic, explicit, and reproducible. Must document all sources, keywords, and dates. Aims for exhaustive coverage.                  |
| **Selection of Studies** | Based on the researcher's judgment. Criteria are often implicit.              | Based on pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria applied consistently.                                                           | Based on pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Often involves two independent reviewers to reduce bias.                            |
| **Documentation**        | Not typically reported in a replicable manner.                                | Meticulously documented. Often reported using a PRISMA-ScR (PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews) flow diagram.                   | Meticulously documented. Reported using a PRISMA flow diagram.                                                                         |
| **Critical Appraisal**   | Critical evaluation is performed, but the method is usually not standardized. | Optional. Quality appraisal is not a mandatory component, as the goal is to map the evidence regardless of its quality.           | Mandatory. A formal, standardized quality assessment of each included study using established tools is required.                       |
| **Synthesis**            | Narrative synthesis, organizing findings into themes.                         | A narrative synthesis or "charting" of the data, where key concepts are mapped out and summarized thematically. No meta-analysis. | Can be a narrative synthesis, but often involves a meta-analysis (statistical combination of results) if data permit.                  |
| **Reporting**            | A chapter in a thesis or a section in a paper.                                | Published as a standalone paper following specific guidelines like PRISMA-ScR.                                                    | Published as a standalone paper that follows strict reporting guidelines like the PRISMA statement.                                    |
| **Reviewer(s)**          | Often a subjective assessment by a single expert.                             | Can be done by one reviewer, but at least two are recommended to reduce bias.                                                     | Minimum of two independent reviewers required for screening and data extraction to minimize bias. A third reviewer resolves conflicts. |

## 1.3 From Research Gap to Research Rationale - The Problem Statements

Once you have identified a research topic, such as the link between internet addiction and mental health among students, and pinpointed a potential research gap, the next crucial step is to build a clear rationale for your study. This process involves more than just spotting a gap, it requires you to challenge the underlying assumptions in the existing literature to highlight why your research is needed and what new insights it can offer.

To articulate a strong motivation for your study, you should clearly explain:

* **What** your research adds to the current understanding of the topic (i.e., its core contribution).
* **Why** your findings will be valuable to other researchers and practitioners in the field.
* **How** you plan to advance the literature (i.e., your research approach).

This step, combined with motivating the research by outlining the what (contribution), why (value), and how (approach) establishes the rationale and importance of the study. Together, this gap identification and justification form the core of a research proposal's **Problem Statement**. A strong problem statement is a concise description of a health issue that needs to be addressed through investigation. It is a declarative statement that frames the problem in a way that highlights a clear gap in knowledge and provides a compelling rationale for the study. Its primary purpose is to articulate the five "**W's**" of the health problem: What is the issue, who is affected, where and when is it occurring, and why is it important to study. (see [Box Information 2](resources/box-2-problem_statements.md) for elaboration on and examples of Problems Statements)

The above process of justifying your study naturally leads to theorization, which is the step where you connect your research gap to a structured plan for finding an answer. You do this by selecting an established theory to serve as an analytical lens, which is also known as your study's theoretical framework. Using an established theory provides the necessary structure and epidemiological designs to investigate the problem, refine your research questions, and guide the conduct of the research, and your statistical analysis, ensuring your study is built on a solid scientific foundation.

## 1.4 Understanding Your Study's Foundation: Theoretical and Conceptual Frameworks

After conducting a thorough literature review, the next step is to synthesize that knowledge into a coherent structure that will guide your study. This is done by developing a theoretical or conceptual framework. These frameworks serve as the critical link between the existing literature and your own research, helping to clarify your research problem, provide scientific support or justify your study, and provide a direct path to formulating your research questions and objectives, and analytical approaches. See some examples [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a_8mxlcV5jVlJBhavx6Alhr8lXOVa-2H/view?usp=sharing).

**What is a Theoretical Framework?**

A Theoretical Framework is the specific, established theory that provides the main lens through which you will investigate your research problem. It is usually based on a single, formal theory with well-defined principles and propositions, that has been tested and confirmed by previous research. For example, a study on patient adherence to treatment might use the Health Belief Model as its theoretical framework. This framework provides the core concepts (e.g., perceived susceptibility, perceived severity) and the established relationships between them that will guide your study to further examine these or related concepts in your setting. You cannot create your own personal theory here; the purpose is to use an existing, validated one as your foundation. In certain research topics, the use of more than one theories may be needed or from other disciplines of fields of study.

**What is a Conceptual Framework?**

A Conceptual Framework is broader and is often what researchers develop for their specific study. It is the researcher’s synthesis of relevant ideas that explains the relationships between the key variables in the study. While a theoretical framework is based on one formal theory, a conceptual framework can be built from several sources, if needed (often so) to explain all the important factors in a new research. Therefore, the sources of conceptual frameworks:

* It might integrate parts of one or more formal theories.
* It can include concepts and models from different fields (e.g., combining psychological theories with sociological observations).
* It incorporates empirical findings and best practices from your literature review.

Essentially, the conceptual framework is your study's specific model. It shows how your research question fits into the bigger picture, illustrates the expected relationships between your variables (e.g., factors influencing academic success or patient self-management), and makes your assumptions explicit. It is often represented visually as a diagram that supplements a narrative explanation, showing exactly what you plan to study and how you believe the different factors are connected.

**The Evolution of Frameworks Through Research**

While frameworks provide the initial structure for a study, they are not always static. One of the most significant contributions a study can make is to challenge or refine an existing theory. A theoretical framework _can be modified_ when your research findings consistently and robustly contradict the predictions of the original theory.

For instance, if your data reveals a new, critical factor that the original theory didnot account for, or shows that an established relationship between variables does not hold true in a specific context, this may suggest the theory needs updating. This process is fundamental to scientific advancement, it is how theories evolve and become more accurate over time. While this is less common in simple prevalence surveys, in-depth analytical studies or qualitative research can generate new insights that lead to the evolution of a conceptual framework into a new, more refined theory.

## 1.5 Formulate a Clear Research Question and Objectives

A great study starts with a great question, that is well-informed of the exisitng corpus of knowledge and evidence, and of course the lack of it. For a prevalence study, your question should be clear, focused, and relevant.

The **PECOTS** Structure:

* **Population**: Who are you studying? (e.g., primary school teachers, elderly in rural areas)
* **Exposure**: What are you measuring? (e.g., depression, smoking habits)
* **Comparison** or **Context**: Is there a comparison group? Or, what is the specific context of the issue?
* **Outcome**: What is the effect you are looking for?
* **Timing** and **Setting**: When and where? (In review, this is study designs).

A simple formula for a prevalence question is: "What is the prevalence of \[condition] among \[population] in \[setting]?". For an example of the PECOTS worked out [HERE](resources/PECOTS-example.md).

\


### **From Question to Objectives: Two Sides of the Same Coin**

A research project is driven by curiosity, which takes the form of a **research question**. However, to answer that question systematically, you must translate your curiosity into a concrete plan of action. This plan is articulated through our **research objectives**.

Think of them as two sides of the same coin:

* **The Research Question** is the **"inquisitive" side**. It is what you want to _know_. It is always phrased as a question (e.g., "What is the prevalence of...?").
* **The Research Objectives** are the **"active" side**. They are what you will _do_ to find the answer. They are always phrased as a statement of intent, using strong action verbs (e.g., "To determine the prevalence of...").

Essentially, your objectives are the specific, measurable steps you'll take to answer your research question. They transform your broad aim into a clear, actionable roadmap for your entire study.

\


### **From Question to Objectives: Creating Your Study's Roadmap**

Your objectives are the specific, measurable steps you'll take to answer your research question. They transform your broad aim into a clear, actionable roadmap for your entire study. There are two common frameworks for stating objectives. Choosing the right one signals the nature of your study.

1. **General & Specific Objectives:** This is the most common framework for **observational or descriptive studies**, including prevalence studies, surveys, and dissertations. It outlines a main, overarching goal and the series of steps required to achieve it. Since all the objectives are to be achieved, the sample size estimation is powered to answer all of them i.e. choosing the largest estimated sample size.
2. **Primary & Secondary Objectives:** This framework is the standard for **experimental or hypothesis-testing studies**, especially clinical trials (RCTs).
   * The **Primary Objective** is the single, most important question the study is powered to answer (e.g., "To determine if Drug A is superior to a placebo...").
   * **Secondary Objectives** are other important questions that are exploratory or not the central focus of the study's statistical power.

For most prevalence studies, the **General and Specific Objectives** framework is the most widely used.

\


### **A Detailed Example: General & Specific Objectives**

Let's look at how a research question is broken down into a clear set of objectives.

**Research Question:** "What is the prevalence of problematic internet use among university students at our university, and what factors are associated with it?"

#### **General Objective:**

The general objective is your main, "big-picture" goal. It mirrors the research question.

> **Example:** To determine the prevalence and identify the associated factors of problematic internet use among students at University X.

#### **Specific Objectives:**

The specific objectives are the smaller, actionable steps that logically allow you to achieve your general objective. They should begin with strong action verbs.

> **Example:** To achieve the general objective, we will pursue the following specific objectives:
>
> 1. To **describe** the sociodemographic, academic, and lifestyle characteristics of the study sample. This objective may not be necessary because all research have to first describe the study samples and to establish representativeness of them to the target population. See [Box Information 3](resources/box-3-generalizability.md) for further explanation.
> 2. To **determine** the prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe problematic internet use among the student population.
> 3. To **identify** the key sociodemographic and lifestyle factors associated with a higher risk of problematic internet use.
> 4. To **examine** the association between the severity of problematic internet use and self-reported academic performance.

**Key Takeaway:** Notice how the specific objectives are not random. They are a logical sequence: first, you describe your sample (**1**), then you measure the main outcome (**2**), then you analyze the relationships you want to understand (**3 & 4**). Together, they comprehensively answer the general objective.
