# Part 1: Finding Your Idea

The first, and often most challenging, step is identifying a research topic. This involves spotting gaps in current knowledge and shaping a broad idea into a focused, feasible research question.

## 1.1 Identify a Research Gap 
A research gap is an area that lacks sufficient exploration, has unresolved issues, or shows contradictory findings in existing literature. Identifying a gap ensures your work contributes something new and valuable.

Types of Research Gaps to Look For:

* **Knowledge Gaps**: Topics that are new or understudied, such as the mental health impact of emerging social media platforms. This might be gotten from comprehensive systematic review.
* **Conceptual Gaps**: Theories or ideas that are inconsistently defined or understood, like the complex relationship between economic inequality and health outcomes.
* **Methodological Gaps**: Areas where existing research methods are insufficient to study a problem accurately, or the issues have not been investigated from different or rigorous manners.
* **Data Gaps**: A lack of reliable, complete, or long-term data needed to draw firm conclusions, such as in regional climate science on certain health conditions.
* **Practical Gaps**: A disconnect between theoretical knowledge and its real-world application, like testing effective teaching strategies in actual classrooms.

Techniques for Finding Gaps:
* **Comprehensive Literature Review**: Read current research papers, systematic reviews, and clinical guidelines to find unanswered questions or outdated findings. Use tools like PubMed and Google Scholar. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are emerging fast and worth mastering. At the time of the writing of this guide, tools such as [Elicit AI](https://elicit.com/), [Silvi AI](https://www.silvi.ai/), [DistillerSR](https://www.distillersr.com/), [EPPI-Reviewer](https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=2914), [Consensus AI](https://consensus.app/), and other assisting tools such as [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/), [Undermind AI](https://www.undermind.ai/), [Evidence Review Accelerator (TERA)](https://tera-tools.com/), [Covidence](https://www.covidence.org/) and [Rayyan](https://www.rayyan.ai/).
* **Examine Study Limitations**: The "limitations" section of published articles often points directly to areas needing further research.
* **Observe Clinical Practice**: Notice patterns in patient presentation, treatment responses, or healthcare access that don't align with existing literature.
* **Engage in Discussions**: Talk with peers, mentors, and experts at conferences or journal clubs to brainstorm and validate potential research ideas.

## 1.2 Understanding Your Study's Foundation: Theoretical and Conceptual Frameworks
After conducting a thorough literature review, the next step is to synthesize that knowledge into a coherent structure that will guide your study. This is done by developing a theoretical or conceptual framework. These frameworks serve as the critical link between the existing literature and your own research, helping to clarify your research problem, provide scientific support or justify your study, and provide a direct path to formulating your research questions and objectives. See some examples HERE.

**What is a Theoretical Framework?**

A Theoretical Framework is the specific, established theory that provides the main lens through which you will investigate your research problem. It is based on a single, formal theory with well-defined principles and propositions, that has been tested and confirmed by previous research. For example, a study on patient adherence to treatment might use the Health Belief Model as its theoretical framework. This framework provides the core concepts (e.g., perceived susceptibility, perceived severity) and the established relationships between them that will guide your study to further examine these or related concepts in your setting. You cannot create your own personal theory here; the purpose is to use an existing, validated one as your foundation.

**What is a Conceptual Framework?**

A Conceptual Framework is broader and is often what researchers develop for their specific study. It is the researcher’s synthesis of relevant ideas that explains the relationships between the key variables in the study. While a theoretical framework is based on one formal theory, a conceptual framework can be built from several sources: 
  * It might integrate parts of one or more formal theories.
  * It can include concepts and models from different fields (e.g., combining psychological theories with sociological observations).
  * It incorporates empirical findings and best practices from your literature review.
  
Essentially, the conceptual framework is your study's specific model. It shows how your research question fits into the bigger picture, illustrates the expected relationships between your variables (e.g., factors influencing academic success or patient self-management), and makes your assumptions explicit. It is often represented visually as a diagram that supplements a narrative explanation, showing exactly what you plan to study and how you believe the different factors are connected.

**The Evolution of Frameworks Through Research**

While frameworks provide the initial structure for a study, they are not always static. One of the most significant contributions a study can make is to challenge or refine an existing theory. A theoretical framework can be modified when your research findings consistently and robustly contradict the predictions of the original theory.

For instance, if your data reveals a new, critical factor that the original theory didnot account for, or shows that an established relationship between variables does not hold true in a specific context, this may suggest the theory needs updating. This process is fundamental to scientific advancement—it is how theories evolve and become more accurate over time. While this is less common in simple prevalence surveys, in-depth analytical studies or qualitative research can generate new insights that lead to the evolution of a conceptual framework into a new, more refined theory.


## 1.3 Formulate a Clear Research Question and Objectives 
A great study starts with a great question, that is well-informed of the exisitng corpus of knowledge and evidence, and of course the lack of it. For a prevalence study, your question should be clear, focused, and relevant.

The **PICO**/**PECOTS** Structure:
* **Population**: Who are you studying? (e.g., primary school teachers, elderly in rural areas)
* **Intervention**/**Exposure**: What are you measuring? (e.g., depression, smoking habits)
* **Comparison** or **Context**: Is there a comparison group? Or, what is the specific context of the issue?
* **Outcome**: What is the effect you are looking for?
* **Timing** and **Setting**: When and where? (In review, this is study designs).

A simple formula for a prevalence question is: "What is the prevalence of \[condition] among \[population] in \[setting]?". From Question to Objectives: Your objectives are the specific, measurable steps you'll take to answer your question.

* **General Objective**: Your main, big-picture goal.
  * Example: To estimate the prevalence of mental health disorders from internet addiction among university students.
* **Specific Objectives**: Smaller, actionable goals. Use verbs like to determine, to identify, to describe.
  * Example: To identify factors associated with high-risk internet use.
