Example 1 ([The PODSAS Study](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-034458))

Based on the various study done in Malaysia, the incidence of postpartum depression and psychological disorders range from 3.9 to 28.8%.3,4,42 There was no past study with a population that is the same for our study. We take the approach of best estimation of the incidence rate for postpartum depression and psychological disorders to be at 10%. Using logistic regression in the GPower 3.1.2 and with estimated proportion of postpartum depression and psychological disorders as 10%, with the smallest odd ratio of 2.5 of the potential risk factor42 with 0.80 power and significance at two-sided α of 0.05, the estimated sample size is 321. Taking into consideration of about 30% of non-response rate and incomplete or missing data in patient’s medical record and questionnaires returned, the sample size needed becomes 459.

Example 2 ([The PA-SCID Study](https://medic.upm.edu.my/upload/dokumen/2020123014400008_MJMHS_0326.pdf))

The required sample size to estimate 5% (lowest proportion) returned to paid work in the first year since injury among the people with SCID with the power 0.80 and α 0.05 at two tails is 786. Also based on our primary objective of quality of life, assuming that 15 predictors account for 10% of the variance of quality of life in a random model multiple linear regression at two tails, the ρ2 is 0.10, and the required sample size is 213 subjects to achieve the same power and α levels used for the sample size estimation for the lowest proportion of returning to a paid work. Thus, we use the larger required sample size of 786 and inflate it with 50% non-response and non-completion rates (36,37); the required number of participants.
