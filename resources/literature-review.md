# A Detailed 7-Step Guide to Reviewing Non-Interventional Studies

This elaborates on each step for a literature review focused on _observational evidence_. It builds upon the techniques you've just learned for identifying a potential research gap.

**Crucially, this process is often a cycle, not a straight line.** The following steps are the formal method to explore, confirm, and precisely define the gap you have preliminarily identified. Be prepared to revisit earlier steps as you learn more.

## Step 1: Start with a Research Gap and Formulate a Focused Question

Your research journey begins with identifying a potential gap, using the techniques described previously whether it's a **Knowledge Gap** you found in a systematic review, a **Practical Gap** you observed in your clinical practice, or a **Methodological Gap** noted in the limitations of a key paper. This first step is about translating that initial, sometimes vague, gap into a precise and answerable research question using the `PECOTS` framework.

**Action:** State the preliminary research gap you have identified. Then, transform it into a focused `PECOTS` question that you can use to systematically test and explore that gap.

## Step 2: Develop and Execute a Search Strategy

This comprehensive search will now thoroughly investigate the 'gap' you identified. Think like a detective, using a structured approach to find all the relevant evidence.

**Action:** Identify databases (e.g., `PubMed/Medline`, `Scopus`, `CINAHL`), list keywords from your `PECOTS` question, and document your entire search process, including the date and the AI-assisted tools you used (e.g., `Elicit`, `Consensus AI`). At the time of the writing of this guide, AI tools include [Elicit AI](https://elicit.com/), [Silvi AI](https://www.silvi.ai/), [DistillerSR](https://www.distillersr.com/), [EPPI-Reviewer](https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=2914), [Consensus AI](https://consensus.app/), and other assisting tools such as [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/), [Undermind AI](https://www.undermind.ai/), [Evidence Review Accelerator (TERA)](https://tera-tools.com/), [Covidence](https://www.covidence.org/) and [Rayyan](https://www.rayyan.ai/).

> **Reality Check (Iteration Point):** Your search will confirm whether the gap truly exists. You might find it has already been filled, or that it is different than you first thought. This is a critical finding! Be prepared to **go back to Step 1** to refine or even change your `PECOTS` research question.

## Step 3: Screen and Select Studies Systematically

Filter your results fairly using pre-defined rules, focusing on the most relevant study designs for your non-interventional question.

**Action:**
1.  **Set Your Rules:** Before you start, define your **inclusion and exclusion criteria** based on your `PECOTS` question. Be specific about the study designs you will accept (e.g., "Include: cohort and case-control studies." "Exclude: randomized controlled trials, case reports.").
2.  **Do a Two-Pass Screening:**
    * **Pass 1:** Read only the titles and abstracts. Quickly exclude irrelevant articles.
    * **Pass 2:** Read the full text of the remaining articles to make your final decision.

## Step 4: Critically Appraise the Evidence

Observational studies have different potential biases than clinical trials (e.g., confounding). As a clinician, you must judge the quality and reliability of this evidence carefully.

**Action:** Use a standardized checklist designed for observational studies. Do not use a checklist for trials. Excellent tools include the **CASP checklists for Cohort or Case-Control Studies**, or the **Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS)**.

## Step 5: Extract and Synthesize the Findings

This is where you pull the key information out of each paper. For observational studies, you'll be looking for measures of association, not just treatment effects.

**Action:** Create a simple table (a "data extraction form"). Columns should include: `Author & Year`, `Study Design`, `Population (n=...)`, `Exposure`, `Comparator`, `Key Findings (e.g., Odds Ratio [OR], Relative Risk [RR])`, and `Quality Appraisal Notes`. This allows you to easily compare results and identify patterns.

> **Reality Check (Iteration Point):** As you synthesize, you might uncover a new, more nuanced gap you hadn't anticipated. This is a valuable discovery! It may require you to **return to Step 2** to conduct a smaller, more targeted search on this new aspect.

## Step 6: Define the Confirmed Gap and Its Clinical Relevance

After systematically reviewing the literature, you are no longer working with a preliminary gap. This step is about precisely articulating the specific gap that your comprehensive review has now confirmed and defined.

**Action:** Write a clear summary of the confirmed gap. Classify its type (e.g., is it a **Knowledge Gap** because no local Malaysian data exists? Or a **Methodological Gap** because all prior studies used a weak design?). Most importantly, this would explain the "**so what?** - ***The Why & The What***". 

## Step 7: Construct Your Argument and Position Your Research

Finally, use the story you have uncovered to build a compelling and evidence-based case for your own research project. Filling the identified gap with your proposed study objectives and study designs is clinically relevant to your patients or the healthcare system, contributing to the Problem Statement section.

**Action:** Write a clear narrative that flows logically from the initial problem, to the existing evidence, to the **confirmed gap you have precisely defined**, and finally to the justification for your proposed study, which is now positioned to make a valuable new contribution.

## Summary

> In essence, this 7-step guide provides a structured and iterative framework to move from a preliminary research idea to a fully justified study. The process begins by translating a potential research gap whether identified from clinical practice or from existing literature, into a focused `PECOTS` question. You then systematically search for, screen, and critically appraise the relevant evidence, embracing the iterative nature of research where initial findings may lead you to refine your approach. This rigorous synthesis does more than just summarize what is known, it allows you to confirm, precisely define, and articulate the clinical relevance of the research gap. Ultimately, completing these steps equips you with a powerful, evidence-based argument, positioning your own study to make a meaningful contribution to the field.
