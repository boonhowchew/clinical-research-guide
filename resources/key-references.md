  * The EQUATOR Network (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research): An online library of reporting guidelines for various study types. It is an essential resource for finding the correct reporting checklist for your specific study design. For observational studies like cross-sectional designs, the key guideline is the STROBE statement, which can be found on the EQUATOR website.
