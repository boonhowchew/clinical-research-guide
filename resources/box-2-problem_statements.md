# Box 2: Problem Statements

{% hint style="success" %}
#### Crafting a Problem Statement in Clinical Research

Think of your entire research project as a building. The problem statement is its foundation and blueprint combined. It is the single most critical element that sets the stage for everything that follows, from your methods to your conclusions. It is not merely a summary or reiteration of the literature review and research question, but it is a concise, compelling argument that identifies a critical issue, demonstrates its urgency, and maps out a clear gap in our current knowledge that your study will address.

A masterfully crafted problem statement must definitively answer three core questions:

1. **What is the problem?** (The Issue)
2. **Why does it matter?** (The Significance)
3. **What is missing?** (The Gap)

Here are the non-negotiable components that form the structure of a powerful problem statement.


**1. Clear Identification and Description of the Problem (The "What")**

This is the starting point where you define the issue with epidemiological precision. Vague statements lead to weak research. Your goal is clarity and focus.

* **Be Specific and Focused:** Avoid merely broad description of the topic. A poorly focused question like, "What is our experience with a particular surgical procedure?" offers no clear direction. Instead, a focused question like, "What is the five-year survival rate for patients with Stage II lung cancer undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery versus a traditional open thoracotomy?" is testable and specific, and could generate appealing problem statements.
* **Define Your Variables Explicitly:** Clearly state the primary health outcome of concern (e.g., disease, condition, behavior) and the key determinants or exposures you are investigating. This shows you have a clear plan for measurement and analysis.
* **Clarify Terminology:** Define any technical or specialized concepts central to your study. Do not assume your audience, including reviewers from different specialties, will understand the specific context. This ensures everyone starts on the same page.


**2. Significance and Relevance of the Problem (The "Why")**

Here, you must convince your audienceâ€”reviewers, funders, and colleagues that this problem is urgent and impactful. This is where you create "the hook."

* **Quantify the Burden:** The most effective way to demonstrate significance in clinical research is with numbers. State the magnitude of the problem using key epidemiological measures:
  * **Prevalence:** What proportion of the population has this condition?
  * **Incidence:** What is the rate of new cases appearing over time?
  * **Morbidity & Mortality:** What are the rates of illness, disability, and death associated with the problem?
  * **Consequences:** What is the economic burden or impact on quality of life?
    
* **Establish Clinical Motivation:** Justify why this study is necessary from a clinical and biological standpoint. Connect the problem directly to patient outcomes. Explain how the current standard of care is insufficient or how a new understanding could lead to tangible improvements in diagnosis, treatment, or prevention.
  
* **Identify the Audience and Impact:** Explicitly state who will benefit from your research (e.g., patients, clinicians, policymakers, public health officials) and how they will use the findings. The ultimate goal of clinical research is to improve patient health, and your problem statement must reflect this.


**3. Identification of the Gap in Existing Knowledge (The "What's Missing")**

No research exists in a vacuum. This section demonstrates that you have mastered the existing literature and are ready to contribute something new and valuable.

* **Synthesize Extant Knowledge:** Briefly summarize what is already known about the problem. This sets the context and demonstrates your expertise.
* **Explicitly State the Deficiency:** Pinpoint exactly what remains unknown. A research gap isn't just a topic that hasn't been studied, it's a specific deficiency. Examples include:
  * A known intervention has not been tested in a specific, high-risk population.
  * Previous studies have shown conflicting or inconclusive results that need to be reconciled.
  * The voices or experiences of underrepresented groups have been absent from the literature.
* **Problematize the Issue:** Elevate your statement from simply "gap-spotting" to true "problematization." This involves challenging the underlying theoretical assumptions in the field to generate novel insight and explaining how your research will augment the literature and add unique value.


**4. A Clear Link to the Study's Purpose and Research Question**

The problem statement must flow logically and inevitably to the purpose of your study. The preceding sections should build a case so compelling that your research question becomes the obvious, necessary next step. This section serves as the bridge, declaring the direct intent of your study and how it will address the problem, significance, and gap you have so carefully outlined. If your methodology is unique (e.g., using a cross-sectional or mixed-methods approach), you should briefly justify why it is essential for solving the problem you've presented.

In summary, a robust problem statement is a conceptually rigorous narrative that is grounded in evidence. It must clearly define a feasible problem, establish its clinical significance, and identify a precise knowledge gap that your research is uniquely positioned to fill.

### **Example 1: A Prevalence Study using a Cross-Sectional Design**

**Research Area:** Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) with co-existing Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in a Primary Care Setting.

**Problem Statement:**

**(The Problem)**
The management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and co-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) presents a significant clinical challenge. Achieving optimal glycemic control is crucial to prevent complications, yet treatment is complicated by an increased risk of adverse events such as hypoglycemia, and altered drug metabolism due to impaired renal function.

**(Significance & Urgency)**
This dual diagnosis is a major public health issue. In Malaysia, approximately 40% of the 3.9 million adults with T2D are estimated to have some degree of CKD. This patient subgroup faces a three-fold higher risk of cardiovascular mortality and progression to end-stage renal disease compared to T2D patients with normal kidney function. The substantial annual healthcare expenditure for managing this comorbidity underscores the urgent need to understand and improve care at the primary care level, where the majority of these patients are managed.

**(The Knowledge Gap)**
While the latest overall burden of T2D and CKD is known, there is a significant **data gap** regarding the current status of glycemic control specifically within this dual-diagnosis population in a real-world primary care setting in Malaysia. Most existing data comes from large international trials or specialized tertiary hospital settings, which may not reflect the realities of management in local primary care clinics. The precise prevalence of suboptimal glycemic control and the patient-specific factors associated with it in this specific, high-risk population remain largely unquantified.

**(Purpose & Research Question)**
Therefore, this study aims to **determine the prevalence** of suboptimal glycemic control (defined as HbA1c > 7.0%) and to identify its associated clinical and demographic factors among patients with Type 2 Diabetes and co-existing Chronic Kidney Disease attending primary care clinics in the Serdang district.

#### Example 2: A Diagnostic Accuracy Study

**Research Area:** Early detection of sepsis in the Emergency Department (ED).

**Problem Statement:**

**(The Problem)** Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, requires rapid identification and treatment to prevent mortality. In the chaotic environment of the Emergency Department, the early and accurate diagnosis of sepsis is notoriously difficult, as its initial signs and symptoms are often non-specific and mimic other non-infectious inflammatory conditions.

**(Significance & Urgency)** Sepsis remains a leading cause of in-hospital mortality worldwide and is responsible for an estimated 1 in 5 deaths globally. The "Surviving Sepsis" guidelines emphasize immediate intervention, as for every hour of delay in administering appropriate antibiotics, the risk of mortality increases by 7-8%. This places immense pressure on ED physicians to make swift, high-stakes decisions based on imperfect diagnostic information.

**(The Knowledge Gap)** Current standard diagnostic tools, such as the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria, are known to have poor specificity, leading to both the over-treatment of non-infected patients with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, more dangerously, missed or delayed diagnoses in true sepsis cases. While biomarkers like procalcitonin (PCT) have been introduced to aid diagnosis, their real-world clinical utility for reliably differentiating bacterial sepsis from non-infectious inflammatory states in undifferentiated ED patients remains debated, and its performance has not been validated in our local patient population.
