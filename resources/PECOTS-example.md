# A Step-by-Step Guide: Using PECOTS for Your Non-Interventional Study

In non-interventional research, we observe associations, risk factors, and outcomes without assigning a treatment. The `PECOTS` framework is the perfect tool to bring clarity and focus to your research question.

## Step 1: Start with a Broad Observation or Problem

Your research journey begins with a question you have from your clinical practice, your community, or your reading. Itâ€™s usually a broad observation about a potential link between a factor and a health outcome.

**Action:** Write down your observation.

> **Example:** "I've noticed that many of my elderly patients who live alone seem to be admitted to the hospital more frequently than those who live with family."

## Step 2: Define the Population (P)

Now, get specific about **who** you want to study. A well-defined population makes your study feasible and your results easier to interpret.

**Action:** Describe your target group with as much detail as possible. Consider key characteristics like age, gender, health status, and location.

> **Example:** Instead of "elderly patients," specify:
> * `P`: Patients aged 65 years and older, registered at primary care clinics in Seri Kembangan.

## Step 3: Identify the Exposure (E)

The **Exposure** is the main factor, characteristic, or condition you are interested in investigating. In observational studies, this is something you measure, not something you assign.

**Action:** Pinpoint the specific factor you believe might be linked to the outcome.

> **Example:** The initial observation was about living arrangements.
> * `E`: Living alone.

## Step 4: Determine the Comparator (C)

To understand the effect of the exposure, you need a comparison group. The **Comparator** provides a baseline against which the exposure group is measured.

**Action:** Define the group that does not have the exposure.

> **Example:** The natural comparison to living alone is not living alone.
> * `C`: Living with a spouse, family, or other companions.

## Step 5: Specify the Outcome (O)

This is what you plan to measure to see if the exposure has an effect. The **Outcome** must be precise, measurable, and directly relevant to your research problem.

**Action:** Clearly state the outcome you will be measuring.

> **Example:** The observation was about hospital admissions.
> * `O`: Unplanned hospital admission for any cause.

## Step 6: Set the Timing (T) and Setting (S)

This defines the context of your study. The **Timing** clarifies the study duration or follow-up period, while the **Setting** specifies where the research will take place.

**Action:** Define the timeframe for your study and the specific location.

> **Example:**
> * `T` (Timing): Over a follow-up period of one year (from January to December 2026).
> * `S` (Setting): Data will be sourced from patient records at primary care clinics (`klinik kesihatan`) in Seri Kembangan, Selangor.

## Step 7: Assemble the Full PECOTS Question

Now, combine all the elements into a single, well-structured research question. This question will guide your entire study design, data collection, and analysis.

**Action:** Use the components you've defined to write the final question. A helpful template is:

> "In `[P]` within `[S]`, is `[E]` compared to `[C]` associated with a higher/lower risk of `[O]` over `[T]`?"

### Putting It All Together (Final Research Question):

> "In patients aged 65 and older registered at primary care clinics in Seri Kembangan (`P`, `S`), who are living alone (`E`) compared to those living with others (`C`) associated with a higher risk of unplanned hospital admission (`O`) over a one-year follow-up period (`T`)?"
