# Box 3: Generalizability

{% hint style="success" %} 
A robust sampling strategy and an adequate sample size are critical for ensuring the generalizability of your findings. Generalizability, or external validity, refers to how confidently the results from your study sample can be applied to a broader group of interest.

### Defining the Target Population: The Role of Eligibility Criteria

The first step in generalizability is defining your target population, and this is done through your study's eligibility criteria. The inclusion and exclusion criteria dictate the specific group to which your findings can be directly applied.

For example, if a study's criteria include only patients aged 18-65 with newly diagnosed hypertension and no other comorbidities, the results can only be generalized to that specific group. The findings may not be applicable to patients over 65 or those with co-existing conditions like diabetes.

**There is often a trade-off**:

* **Narrow Criteria**: Create a very specific, uniform group. This can increase a study's internal validity by reducing confounding variables.
* **Broad Criteria**: Create a more diverse group that better reflects the "real-world" patient population. This increases external validity, making the results more generalizable.

### Reaching the Target Population: The Role of Sampling

Once the target population is defined, your sampling strategy determines how you select a representative sample from it. A sample that mirrors the characteristics of the target population (e.g., age, disease severity) is essential for generalizable results.

* **Probability sampling** is the ideal method for achieving a representative sample because it minimizes selection bias.
* When using **non-probability sampling** (e.g., consecutive or convenience sampling), which is common in clinical research, you must carefully describe your sample's characteristics so that others can assess the limits of generalizability.

### How Sample Size Affects Generalizability

While the sampling method determines who is in your study, the sample size determines the reliability of your findings. An inadequate sample size severely limits generalizability for two key reasons:

* It can lead to an underpowered study that may fail to detect a genuine association, making the findings unreliable.
* It produces imprecise estimates with wide confidence intervals, making the results of little practical use for the broader population.
Calculating the correct sample size ensures that your study's results are precise and reliable enough to be considered for generalization.
