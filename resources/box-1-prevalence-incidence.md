# Box 1: Prevalence & Incidence

{% hint style="info" %}
Prevalence measures the proportion of a population that has a specific disease or condition. It provides a snapshot of the existing disease burden on a population, which is crucial for resource allocation and healthcare planning. While the term prevalence proportion is technically more precise, "prevalence" is commonly used.

• **Point Prevalence**: This is the most common measure. It quantifies the proportion of individuals who have a disease at a single point in time. If the term "prevalence" is used without further specification, it generally implies point prevalence.

$$
Prevalence = \frac{Number \ of \ existing \ cases \ at \ a \ specific \ time}{Total \ population \ at \ that \ same \ time}
$$

For example, if 138 out of 2,000 individuals in a general practice are being treated for asthma, the point prevalence of diagnosed asthma is 138/2000=0.069 or 6.9%. The result can be expressed as a proportion, a percentage, or for smaller values, per 1,000 or 100,000 population.

It's important to note that prevalence is a proportion, not a rate. It is dimensionless and ranges from 0 to 1 (or 0% to 100%). The term "prevalence rate" is a misnomer because the denominator does not involve a measure of time. Prevalence is influenced by both the incidence of new cases and the average duration of the condition.

Incidence measures the occurrence of new cases of a disease in a population over a specified period. It is the key measure for investigating the etiology of a disease, evaluating preventive measures, and determining risk. There are two main measures of incidence.

• **Cumulative Incidence (Risk)**: This is the proportion of an initially disease-free population that develops the disease over a specified period. It represents the average risk of developing the disease during that time frame.

$$
Cumulative \ Incidence = \frac{Number \ of \ new \ cases \ during \ a \ period}{Number \ of \ people \ at \ risk \ at \ the \ start \ of \ the \ period}
$$

As a proportion, its value is between 0 and 1. For example, if 20 individuals in a group of 1,000 disease-free people develop influenza over one month, the cumulative incidence is 20/1000=0.02, or a 2% risk over one month.

• An attack rate is a type of cumulative incidence used during a disease outbreak, calculated for a narrow period.

• **Incidence Rate (Incidence Density)**: This is a true rate that measures the speed at which new cases arise in a population. It is preferred in studies with long or variable follow-up times, as it accounts for individuals being observed for different lengths of time.

$$
Incidence \ Rate = \frac{Number \ of \ new \ cases \ during \ a \ period}{Total \ person-time \ at \ risk}
$$

The denominator, person-time, is the sum of the time each person in the population remained disease-free and under observation (e.g., person-years, person-months). The result has units of time⁻¹ (e.g., cases per 100 person-years). For instance, an incidence rate of 74 cases per 100,000 person-years indicates that, on average, 74 new cases are expected for every 100,000 years of observation time contributed by at-risk individuals.

The Relationship Between **Prevalence** and **Incidence** In a stable population (where incidence and death/cure rates are constant), prevalence is directly related to both incidence and the average duration of the disease. This relationship can be approximated by the formula:

**Prevalence ≈ Incidence Rate × Average Disease Duration**

This equation highlights that a high prevalence can be due to a high incidence (many new cases) or a long disease duration (slow cure or death rate), or both. For example, the high prevalence of hypertension is due to both a high incidence and its chronic, lifelong nature. Conversely, the common cold has a high incidence but a low prevalence because its duration is short.
