# Introduction

A living guide to planning a clinical research survey.

Welcome! This guide is crafted for students, clinicians, and aspiring researchers who are ready to turn their curiosity into a meaningful research survey. Scientific research, including surveys in medicine and health sciences, begin not with complex methods but with a clear and compelling question. This walkthrough will demystify the process, from finding your research topic to planning the practical details, ensuring you can proceed with confidence and scientific rigor in surveys. For a complete research proposal outline [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HInSYC0M81OhANMIBBqCcI7r_gJmsJqO/view?usp=share_link). Survey research or prevalence studies are good to:

1. Establish foundational clinical standards when defining population-specific "normal" reference ranges for clinical tests (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol, growth charts), which is essential for accurate diagnosis and preventing patient harm from inappropriate standards.
2. Provide the critical prevalence data required for evidence-based allocation of national health budgets, setting public health priorities, and monitoring the effectiveness of interventions or treatments in clinical care and medical services.
3. Quantify disease burden of existing or emerging illnesses in the community providing the objective evidence needed to reveal the actual level of the illness occurrence, or health disparities and to inform the design targeted services for the targeted populations.

From epidemiological standpoint, it is critical to understand that such a cross-sectional study cannot achieve the following study objectives:

1. Determine Causality: It cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship, as exposure and outcome are measured simultaneously, preventing determination of the temporal sequence, except if the exposures are biological parameters that were present at birth e.g., genetic and genomic data, blood type and RF factor, gender, etc.
2. Evaluate Treatment Effects: It cannot determine a treatment's efficacy or effectiveness, as it can only show an association, not the cause-and-effect by controlled trials.
3. Measure Incidence: It cannot measure the rate of new cases of a disease over time; it only captures existing (prevalent) cases.
4. Assess Implementation Processes: It cannot evaluate how well a program was implemented, only its outcome at a single point in time.
5. Study Rare or Brief Conditions: It is inefficient for studying rare diseases or those of short duration, as the "snapshot" is likely to miss these cases.
6. Explore In-Depth Perceptions: It cannot explore complex lived experiences or the "why" behind behaviours, which requires qualitative methods.

This guide applies equally well to the planning and conduct of KAP studies. A Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) study is a quantitative cross-sectional survey designed to assess the levels of knowledge, prevailing attitudes (or beliefs/perceptions), and self-reported practices of a specific population regarding a particular health issue, disease, or treatment/intervention. It is often used to:

* Identify knowledge gaps, cultural beliefs, or behavioural patterns that may facilitate or hinder certain health behaviours, treatments or public health programs.
* Establish a baseline for planning health interventions.
* Evaluate the impact of health education or campaigns post-intervention.
* Inform policy and communication strategies. Variants of this study include KABP (Knowledge, Attitude, Beliefs, Practice) and KAPS (Knowledge, Attitude, Perceptions, Skills), which simply add or substitute dimensions but follow the same core principles.

The [Box Information 1](<resources/Box information 1 Prevalence and Incidence.md>) below defines and explains about prevalence and incidence and related concepts that MUST be grasped.
