### Dedication

This guide is dedicated to the many clinicians, postgraduate trainees, and students I have had the privilege to know. I have seen and felt the profound challenge you face when asked to conduct research to advance your careers or complete your studies.

The principles of epidemiology and statistics may be clear in textbooks, but they often become 'blurred' by the unique complexities of each new research question, the personal preparedness of the researcher, and the varying levels of support available. My hope is that this book serves as a dependable compass through that fog.



I dedicate this work foremost to my God, who moves me in sovereign ways I do not always understand, but always for the good of my country, my institution, my colleagues, my students, and myself.

And to the anchors of my life: my family especially my beloved wife, and my mother, my precious children, and my dear friends who sustain my sanity in countless ways and make all things possible.
