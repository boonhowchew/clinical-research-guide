The first, and often most challenging, step is identifying a research topic. This involves spotting gaps in current knowledge and shaping a broad idea into a focused, feasible research question. For a further elaboration HERE.
1.1 Identify a Research Gap
A research gap is an area that lacks sufficient exploration, has unresolved issues, or shows contradictory findings in existing literature. Identifying a gap ensures your work contributes something new and valuable.


Types of Research Gaps to Look For:

●	Knowledge Gaps: Topics that are new or understudied, such as the mental health impact of emerging social media platforms. This might be gotten from comprehensive systematic review.

●	Conceptual Gaps: Theories or ideas that are inconsistently defined or understood, like the complex relationship between economic inequality and health outcomes.

●	Methodological Gaps: Areas where existing research methods are insufficient to study a problem accurately, or the issues have not been investigated from different or rigorous manners.

●	Data Gaps: A lack of reliable, complete, or long-term data needed to draw firm conclusions, such as in regional climate science on certain health conditions.

●	Practical Gaps: A disconnect between theoretical knowledge and its real-world application, like testing effective teaching strategies in actual classrooms.


Techniques for Finding Gaps:

●	Comprehensive Literature Review: Read current research papers, systematic reviews, and clinical guidelines to find unanswered questions or outdated findings. Use tools like PubMed and Google Scholar. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are emerging fast and worth mastering. At the time of the writing of this guide, tools such as Elicit AI, Silvi AI, DistillerSR, EPPI-Reviewer, Consensus AI, and other assisting tools such as Perplexity AI, Undermind AI, Evidence Review Accelerator (TERA), Covidence and Rayyan.

●	Examine Study Limitations: The "limitations" section of published articles often points directly to areas needing further research.

●	Observe Clinical Practice: Notice patterns in patient presentation, treatment responses, or healthcare access that don't align with existing literature.

●	Engage in Discussions: Talk with peers, mentors, and experts at conferences or journal clubs to brainstorm and validate potential research ideas.
1.2 Formulate a Clear Research Question and Objectives
A great study starts with a great question. For a prevalence study, your question should be clear, focused, and relevant.


The PICO/PECOTS Structure:

●	Population: Who are you studying? (e.g., primary school teachers, elderly in rural areas)

●	I/Exposure or Intervention: What are you measuring? (e.g., depression, smoking habits)

●	Comparison: Is there a comparison group? Or, what is the specific context of the issue?

●	Outcome: What is the effect you are looking for?

●	Timing and Setting: When and where?

A simple formula for a prevalence question is: "What is the prevalence of [condition] among [population] in [setting]?".
From Question to Objectives:
Your objectives are the specific, measurable steps you'll take to answer your question.

●	General Objective: Your main, big-picture goal.

○	Example: To estimate the prevalence of mental health disorders from internet addiction among university students.


●	Specific Objectives: Smaller, actionable goals. Use verbs like to determine, to identify, to describe.

○	Example: To identify factors associated with high-risk internet use.
